							<p><i>If smart metering is going to revolutionise the aggregation of energy use data, why not share these insights with the user?</i></p>
							<!-- Intro Paragraph -->
							<p>(11 September 2018) A good turnout awaited the launch of the <i>Open Banking</i> report authored by Fingleton Associates with support and insights from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). If untethering data for access by unaffiliated parties via Open Banking worked for the banking sector, could it work for the energy sector too? Let's pick out the three meta-recommendations made by the report and untangle them:</p> 
							
							<!-- Machines are people too  -->
																				
							<p><h3>Widening access to... Machines</h3>The first recommendation addresses the lack of standardisation in marketing and tarriff information presented by the Big Six and the independents rapidly building market share:</p>
							<blockquote>Standardising tariffs and other relevant market information in machine-readable formats to allow automated comparisons of energy tariff offerings</blockquote>

							<h3>Relative growth in GDP vs life expectancy (2000 to 2015)</h3>
							
							<p>The table below states percentage change in GDP as well as the average change considering the three countries involved in the assessment where change in GDP is not visibly shifting. If we zoom in, we can see that the GDP of Chile and Mexico is visibly rising, but it's still hard to see a rise for GDP in Zimbabwe (despite the data highlighting a considerable relative rise). This suggests that Zimbabwe's GDP is still a lot lower than the other countries in the assessment.</p>

							<p>Inspite of reduced GDP, life expectancy is higher in Chile and Germany than it is in China and the USA. Let's consider Zimbabwe more carefully. Of the six countries in this analysis, Zimbabwe is the only country has changed over time so drastically in terms of life expectancy. The life expectancy of people in Chile, China, Germany, Mexico and the United States of America grew slowly in the 15 years between 2000 and 2015, but the life expectancy in Zimbabwe grew exponentially from an average life expectancy of 46 in 2000 (comparable to the average life expectancy of men in 18th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period">Edo Japan</a>) to nearly 61 in 2015. Zimbabwe has a world life expectancy ranking of 162, with the <a href="http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/zimbabwe-life-expectancy">top 20 causes of death</a> including road traffic accidents, malnutrition and HIV/AIDs. The meteoric rise in life expectancy doesn't seem to be correlated to GDP rise, so we needed to do some further investigation</p>

							<p>What has happened in the last 15 years that has caused the life expectancy to rise so drastically? Speaking to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zim-life-expectancy-shoots-up/"><i>Chronicle</i></a> newspaper in December 2017, the Minister of Health for Zimbabwe, Dr David Parirenyatwa had the following to say:
								<blockquote>"Zimbabwe had one of the highest HIV/Aids prevalence rates in Africa but we worked so hard that we have the highest drop in HIV statistics on the continent. New infections have dropped drastically. The likelihood of an HIV positive mother giving birth to an HIV positive baby was at 40 percent but because of treatment that we give it’s now at 5.4 percent”</blockquote></p>
							
							<h3>More money = live longer?</h3><p>The violin plot visualises data set in terms of how often certain values appear. The white dot represents the median,  the thick black line in the center of each violin represents the interquartile range and the lines that extend from the center are the confidence intervals. While the data from most of the countries show that life expectancy is approximately the same between 2000 and 2015, Zimbabwe's life expectancy in years has increased dramatically.</p>
							<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danwrisar/danwrisar.github.io/master/images/gdp_lifeexp_violin.JPG" alt=""/></span></div>
							<p>Now, Zimbabwe is reckonised as a 'beacon country' of how to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the continued development of methods alongside state investment in new hospitals, medical centres and staff training suggests that life expectancy may continue to rise in Zimbabwe.</p>
							<p><h3>Further Research</h3>It's important to consider the dataset and the tools used for this analysis. Specifically, the pandas and seaborn packages within python and jupyter notebooks to conduct the analysis. A higher resolution of data (e.g. monthly or by locality) could support policy makers and data scientists to better understand where the issues might be for developing countries. When considering fiurther research, it would be a valid course to investigate correlations between <a href="http://theconversation.com/beyond-gdp-are-there-better-ways-to-measure-well-being-33414">alternative measures of economic growth</a> and critical area spending (e.g. spending on healthcare infrastructure).</p>
